 let can declare immutable objects, constant. it cannot be changed afterwards.you have to assign something to it before first use.
 var can declare variable that can be changed.it can either be assigned right away or at a later time or not at all and can be reassigned at any time.

 Camel Case.The first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of the remaining words is uppercase.

If you don't specify the type of value you need, Swift uses type inference to work out the appropriate type. Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide.

var phoneNumber = 0987654321
//Determined that the the variable type of  is an integer
//phoneNumber = "Hello world."
//Assigned a string to this variable.So it's wrong.
