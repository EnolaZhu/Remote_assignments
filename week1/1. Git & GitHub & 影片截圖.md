| git add | Add all of the changes at the current directory level and subdirectories. |When I get ready to commit, we stage the specific file firstly:`$ git add + <file name>`.We can stage multiple files:`git add` + multiple files name, and we can also stage all changes:`$ git add .`
| git commit | Record the changes to the repository. |After we staged some changes, we want to push the staged content to the local repository. We usually push commits with commit message：`$ git commit -m ""` |
| git log |Shows me all the commits history on my current local branch. |When we make multiple commits or clone a repository， we want to review the commit history.	
|git push [Repo_name] [Branch_name] |Push local commits to the specific branch of the remote repository.|After I made some commits on our local repository, I wanted to sync with the remote repository， so I pushed the local commits to a specific branch of the remote repository by command.
|git remote -v|List all the remote repositories that are associated with the local repository.|When we want to check the remote repositories URL that is associated with our local repository.
|git branch|List all the local branches.|When I want to check all the branches of the local branches.
|fork|Make a copy of a repository in GitHub.|When I want to make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. I can also fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.

> **How to establish a GitHub repo**

1. Create your GitHub account
2. There is a word “repository” in the upper left corner of your GitHub interface. Click the green button with “New” On the right side of the word.
3. Then automatically jump to the next interface where you add details of your repository. You have to write your Repository name about your project， and you can optionally add your project description.
4. Next, you have to choose your REPO permissions， public or private.
5. At last, you can choose to initialize your repository by adding a README file，.gitignore, and license for your need.

| README file| .gitignore | license |
| :-----| :---- | :---- |
|It is a text file that contains some important information for your project， such as the purpose of your project， the way to use your project, etc.|.gitignore file is a plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore， such as user information， build files, cache files, etc.|It’s a protocol about using, changing, and distributing the software. When you want to open your repository, you are better choose a license for protecting your rights and can also make your repository be truly open source. You should also pay attention to the license if you want to fork a repository.

>  **How to upload the local projects to GitHub**

1. Open the terminal, enter the root directory of your local projects and make sure that it's your working directory.
2. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository: `$ git init`.
3. Stage all files: `$ git add .`
4. Commit all the files in the project: `$ git commit -m ""`.`-m ""` lets you add the commit message in line.
5. Establish a repository in GitHub， and copy its URL.
